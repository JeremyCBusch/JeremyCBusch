- Hi, I’m @JeremyCBusch
- I’m interested in anything to do with space and new technology. I love boards sports (skateboarding, snbowboarding, wakeboarding) and love to go hiking.
  I also love being creative, especially with programming solutions to problems.
- I’m currently studying computer science at Brigham Young University Idaho and have learned a lot in C++, Java, and Python
